                I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different
                direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges
                with tools well suited to the job at hand.I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every
                day, experimenting with HTML, CSS.
